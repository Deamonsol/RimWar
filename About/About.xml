Rim War introduces global conquest where factions vie to become the dominant power across the RimWorld.
    
Gone are the days of random bands of raider seeking only plunder and wanton destruction; factions are now in a race to exert their influence across the RimWorld through mobile armies, trade caravans, base settlement, and diplomacy. Arise from the ashes of your unfortunate circumstances and use all the assets at your disposal to become a powerful influence across the globe.

Adds a new winning condition: defeat rival faction

Adds faction power and colony power to determine the size and strength of armies, caravans, and colonies that AI factions can generate. Defeating an enemy army, gifting, or trading with other factions directly affects their faction power. Faction interaction matters - form alliances, subjugate the weak, and destroy dangerous enemies across the world to create winning conditions.

Armies (warbands and scouting parties), settlers, diplomats, and caravans for all factions can now be seen on the world map and will have practical purposes, destinations, and associated events. Existing events such as raids, trader caravans, peace talks and more are all generated by AI action and represented as an icon on the map. The more combat power a settlement has, the more difficult raids or wealthy caravans a faction settlement can generate.

Factions will interact with each other to form alliances or declaring war. Take advantage of warring factions and strike while they are weak; or exploit a friendly faction to fight your wars for you.</description>
