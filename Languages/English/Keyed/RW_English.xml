<RW_VictoryChallengeMessage>Your arrival to the Rim has sparked the ire of the {0}.  They are a ruthless faction that has fractured the solidarity of the planet - there can be no lasting peace as long as they remain. Your presence poses a threat to their schemes and they will hunt you until only one of you remains.

Eliminate the {0} by destroying all their settlements to achieve victory.</RW_VictoryChallengeMessage>
<RW_VictoryAchieved>Victory!

News has spread far and wide of your victory over the vile {0} that has brought peace to the Rim.

Your victory is no small feat; the grit and dedication demonstrated during your Rim War will forever be remembered in the annals of history.

(RimWar statistics coming soon!)</RW_VictoryAchieved>
